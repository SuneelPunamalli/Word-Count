Developed a Java-based Word Count application designed to evaluate and analyze typing performance in real time.
Measures total words typed, character count, and calculates typing speed in terms of Words Per Minute (WPM) and Characters Per Minute (CPM).
Tracks the total time taken to complete the typing task and computes overall accuracy to provide precise performance insights.
Captures user input dynamically and presents results in a clear, structured format, enabling effective performance analysis and improvement.
